# Haikus
// Hello, I'm not sure how to publish websites on Github.
// However, this is supposed to document Haikus that I come up with on inspiration. 
// It is still a work in progress, so please don't judge too much! 
// P.S. I asked for an extension to the 17th, please try to consider it, but I understand if that is not possible.
